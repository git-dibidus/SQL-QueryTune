## Core Features

### 1. Connection Management

- **User-Friendly Connection Setup**
  - **Server Name Field:** Text input for specifying the SQL Server instance.
  - **Database Name Field:** Text input for selecting the target database.
  - **Authentication Mode:**
    - **Windows Authentication:** Option for integrated security.
    - **SQL Server Authentication:** Option to enter User ID and Password.
      - **Conditional Fields:** User ID and Password fields are only visible when SQL Server Authentication is selected.
  - **Test Connection Button:** Validates the entered connection parameters and provides immediate feedback (success/failure message).

### 2. Query Input and Analysis

- **SQL Query Input Panel**
  - Multi-line text box for entering or pasting the SQL query to be analyzed.
  - Syntax highlighting and basic validation (optional enhancement).
- **Run Analysis Button**
  - Triggers the analysis process using the current connection and query.
  - Disables while analysis is running to prevent duplicate submissions.

### 3. Results Display

- **Analysis Results Panel**
  - Displays the HTML report generated by `QueryTune.Core`.
  - Supports rich formatting, including tables, color-coded suggestions, and code snippets.
  - Automatically clears previous results when a new analysis is started.

## Functional Requirements

- **Responsive UI:** The application should remain responsive during analysis (consider background processing).
- **Error Handling:** Clear error messages for connection failures, invalid queries, or analysis errors.
- **Security:** Password fields should mask input; sensitive data should not be logged or stored insecurely.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation and screen reader support for all controls.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Platform:** Windows desktop application (WPF, .NET 8.0).
- **Performance:** Analysis should complete within a reasonable time for typical queries (<10 seconds).
- **Extensibility:** Modular design to allow future enhancements.
